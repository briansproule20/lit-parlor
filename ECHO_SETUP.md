# Echo API Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with Echo API

To enable full AI-powered tutoring functionality, you need to configure your Echo API credentials.

### 1. Get Your Echo App ID

1. Visit [https://echo.merit.systems/](https://echo.merit.systems/)
2. Sign up and create an account
3. Navigate to the API Keys section
4. Create a new API key (App ID)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following content:

```bash
# Echo API Configuration
ECHO_APP_ID=your-actual-echo-app-id-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_ECHO_APP_ID=your-actual-echo-app-id-here
```

**Important:** Replace `your-actual-echo-app-id-here` with your real Echo App ID.

### 3. Environment Variables Explained

- `ECHO_APP_ID`: Used by the server-side API route for authentication
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ECHO_APP_ID`: Used by the client-side to check connection status

### 4. Security Notes

- **Never commit** your `.env.local` file to version control
- The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore`
- Keep your Echo App ID secure and private

### 5. Testing the Integration
