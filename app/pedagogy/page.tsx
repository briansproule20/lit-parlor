                The word "pedagogy" derives from the Greek <em>paidagogos</em>, meaning "leader of children." 
                In ancient Greece, a paidagogos was a slave who escorted children to school and supervised their conduct.

                <strong>Socrates (470-399 BCE)</strong> revolutionized teaching through his method of questioning, 
                known as the Socratic method. Rather than lecturing, he engaged students in dialogue to help them 
                discover knowledge through critical thinking and self-examination. His famous dictum "The unexamined 
                life is not worth living" reflects his belief in the importance of self-reflection in learning.

                <strong>Plato (428-348 BCE)</strong> founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher 
                learning in the Western world. He emphasized the importance of philosophy and mathematics in education, 
                believing that true knowledge came from understanding eternal forms rather than the changing world of 
                appearances.

                <strong>Aristotle (384-322 BCE)</strong> emphasized observation and experience in learning. 
                He believed that knowledge came from both reason and sensory experience, laying the groundwork 
                for empirical approaches to education.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                During the Middle Ages, education was primarily conducted in monasteries and cathedral schools. 
                The <strong>Scholastic method</strong> emerged, emphasizing logical argumentation and the reconciliation 
                of faith with reason. Scholars like Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) sought to harmonize Christian theology 
                with Aristotelian philosophy.

                The Renaissance (14th-17th centuries) saw a revival of classical learning and humanism.

                The Enlightenment (17th-18th centuries) brought new educational philosophies. 
                <strong>John Locke (1632-1704)</strong> argued that the mind was a "tabula rasa" (blank slate) 
                at birth, emphasizing the role of experience and environment in shaping learning. 
                <strong>Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)</strong> advocated for natural education that 
                respected children's natural development and curiosity.

                He believed that education should be experiential and democratic, preparing students for active 
                participation in society. His emphasis on "learning by doing" influenced modern project-based learning.

                <strong>Maria Montessori (1870-1952)</strong> developed an educational method based on scientific
